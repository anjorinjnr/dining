            <p>
                <b>1. Tutor Status. </b>Neither this Agreement, the Terms of Use, nor use of the Site creates an
                independent contractor, employee/employer, partnership, joint venture, or franchiser-franchisee
                relationship between Tutor and NearTutors. It is the parties' intention that the Tutor will be an
                Independent Tutor and not NearTutors's employee for all purposes, including, without limitation, the
                application of the Fair Labor Standards Act minimum wage and overtime provisions, Federal Insurance
                Contribution Act, the Social Security Act, the Federal Unemployment Tax Act, the provisions of the
                Internal Revenue Code, any state income tax law, or any local income tax law, any state workers'
                compensation laws, and any state unemployment insurance law.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>2. Description of Work.</b> The Tutor will be responsible for providing tutoring instruction
                ("Sessions"). The Tutor will retain absolute discretion as to the manner and means of carrying out
                Tutor’s tutoring services. Tutor shall determine Tutor’s own cancellation policy.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>3. Non-exclusivity.</b> Tutor and NearTutors acknowledge that this Agreement is nonexclusive and the
                Tutor is free to engage in and simultaneously perform any employment or other services during the
                pendency of this Agreement. Nothing herein precludes Tutor from advertising or providing Tutor’s
                services to the general public.

                that rate less a percentage paid to NearTutors for its services. The percentage is based on the total number
                of Session hours Tutor has tutored to students that have hired Tutor through NearTutors (“NearTutors student”)
                as set forth in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wyzant.com/sitehelp/paymentpolicies.aspx">Tutor

                Tutor shall be paid through the NearTutors payment processing system for any services rendered to NearTutors
                students. Under no circumstances is Tutor to attempt to seek or receive compensation directly from

                Tutor's administrative page on NearTutors's website (http://www.wyzant.com). If requested by the student and
                for their use, the Tutor will enter a summary of service performed. Subject to the review by the student
